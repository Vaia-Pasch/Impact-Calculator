 IMPACT CALCULATOR, FACTS & SOLUTIONS 

The aim of the project is to calculate how much money & plastic we waste in our daily life. 
You can use the two calculators (plastic bottles of water & beverages) to see your numbers and read the sections on your right in each calculator with some facts and of course with solutions.

The idea is inspired by Projeto Gea, a personal project of mine, which was created in 2019. As Projeto Gea we do cleanUp campaigns to keep neighborhoods free from trash. We have noticed the negative impact we have as consumers and,thus, our purpose is wrapped around those 3 words, REUSE - REDUCE - REFUSE. 

This is the beginning of the project, and since I live for change, it will get usual updates. 

I want to thank the people that have helped me with my code journey, filled with questions, doubts and being stuck, Vageli (vagelisp) for being such a vagelis, Antonis (antonisPanos) a mentor in SHA, Mehmet (sayinmehmet47) my colleague in SHA and Valantis from my workplace.
