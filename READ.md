IMPACT CALCULATOR

The aim of the project is to calculate how much we save if we choose sustainably. 
Examples: 
- How many plastic bottles do we save if we use a reusable bottle to carry our water
- How many single use cups we save if we use a reusable cup
- How many straws we save if we use a metal reusable straw

This is the beginning of the project, only the end will tell what I actually created. 
Nevertheless, with the aim you move forward to the unknown future.
